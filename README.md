This repository contains concise, well-structured notes created while completing the “Introduction to Containers, Kubernetes, and OpenShift” certification by Cognitive Class (IBM Developer Skills Network). The notes cover core concepts such as Docker and containerization, Kubernetes architecture and objects, scaling and rolling updates, ConfigMaps and Secrets, and an overview of the Kubernetes ecosystem including OpenShift, Operators, and service mesh basics. They are refined for clarity and readability, aligned with the course’s hands-on labs and CLI workflows, and can be used either as a learning guide for beginners or a quick revision/cheat sheet for practitioners.
